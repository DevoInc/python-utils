# Devo Python Utils

This package it's an extra for the Devo SDK and our clients. It can be used to:
* Order files.
* Generate fake data.
* File IO generators.

## Requirements

This package require Python 3.5+ and devo-sdk package

## Quick Start
### Installing the package:

You can install the Devo SDK by using `easy_install` or `pip`:

    #option 1
    easy_install devo-utils
    
    #option 2
    pip install devo-utils


You can use sources files, clonning the project too:

    #option 3
    python setup.py install
    
    #option 4
    pip install .
    
    #option 5 - dev option
    pip install -e .

### Documentation

You have specific documentation in _[docs](docs)_ folder for each part of SDK:
* [Faker: fake data](docs/faker.md)
* [File IO](docs/fileio.md)
* [Sorting data](docs/sorter.md)If you wrap a line with the block creator

{% - set .... -%}

Faker will not treat that line as a send line, if a variable is created without the hyphens, for example:

{% set ....%}

Faker will believe that it is a line to send, so you have to keep this in mind

And examples in `examples` folder.


## Contributing
See [Python Utils contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).<br/>

## Launch tests
### run_tests script
You can run tests from the main folder of SDK
To launch this script, you need either the environment variables loaded in the system, or the _environment.env_ file in the root of the SDK with the correct values, since to test all the SDK functionalities it is necessary to connect to Devo for the tests of sending and extracting data. You has a example file called _environment.env.example_

It's normal, by the way, TCP tests fails in clients or not Devo developers systems.

```bash
~/projects/python-utils > python setup.py test 
```

```bash
~/projects/python-utils > python run_tests.py
```

You can add option "Coverage" for create HTML report about tests.

```bash
~/projects/python-utils > python run_tests.py --coverage
```


### Run using Unittest command

You can see references in [unittest documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)

For commands like:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -p "*.py" 
```

If you launch this command from the root directory of the SDK, you need to have the environment variables in your 
system for all the tests that require connection to Devo can work, not being able to use the environment.env file 
as in the script.
