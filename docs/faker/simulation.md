## Simulation fake generator

### Class

* [SimulationFakeGenerator](../../devoutils/faker/generators/simulation_fake_generator.py)

### Doc

This is a basic generator to create simulations on the screen, useful to see how a template 
would work, etc., without risking sending data.

In short, it is a generator to display the data on the screen, as if you activated the flag 
`simulation` and` verbose` in any of the other generators
